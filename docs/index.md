I am a Doctoral Student at [**Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej, Polskiej Akademii Nauk**](https://www.iitis.pl/pl) (IITiS, PAN), Polish Academy of Sciences, and the Joint Doctoral School, [**Politechnika Śląska**](https://www.polsl.pl/en/).

I am currently working under the research project [**Impact of input data alteration and modification of the algorithm parameters on the efficiency of quantum programs**](https://miszczak.eu/grants/qprogmods/), where the works are fundamentally realted to a class of variational quantum algorithms utilizing Reinforcement Learning methods.
