I am a Postdoc at [**HelTeq**](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/helteq/people), University of Helsinki in the group of [**Sabrina Maniscalco**](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/sabrina-maniscalco). My research interests lies in the intersection of classical machine learning and quantum computing, where my primary focus is on harnessing near-term quantum hardware with the help of machine learning methods.

### <span style="color:black"> **Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Qauntum Architecture Search (KANQAS)** </span>

KANQAS utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for quantum architecture search (QAS) problems. QAS is a promising approach for optimizing and automating the design of quantum circuits to achieve quantum advantage.

Our findings points out that the probability of success and the number of optimal quantum circuit configurations generated by KANs to create multi-qubit maximally entangled states are significantly higher compared to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). In presence of hardware noise, KANs can achieve better fidelity in approximating maximally entangled states compared to MLPs, whose performance heavily depends on the choice of activation function.
