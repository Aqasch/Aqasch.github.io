I am a Postdoc at [**HelTeq**](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/helteq/people), University of Helsinki in the group of [**Sabrina Maniscalco**](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/sabrina-maniscalco). My research interests lies in the intersection of classical machine learning and quantum computing, where my primary focus is on harnessing near-term quantum hardware with the help of machine learning methods.

### <span style="color:black"> KANQAS: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Qauntum Architecture Search</span>

KANQAS utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for quantum architecture search (QAS) problems. QAS is a promising approach for optimizing and automating the design of quantum circuits to achieve quantum advantage.

Our findings points out that the probability of success and the number of optimal quantum circuit configurations generated by KANs to create multi-qubit maximally entangled states are significantly higher compared to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). In presence of hardware noise, KANs can achieve better fidelity in approximating maximally entangled states compared to MLPs, whose performance heavily depends on the choice of activation function.

### <span style="color:black"> YAQQ: Yet Another Quantum Quantizer </span>

YAQQ is a software tool for automated quantum gate set design, allowing users to explore and discover optimized sets of quantum gates. It supports three main usage modes: (1) gate set compiler, (2) gate set comparator, and  (3) gate set discovery. The gate set discovery mode is the core novelty of YAQQ, iteratively refining a new gate set based on a defined cost function and comparing it against a predefined gate set

YAQQ is an elaborated and user-friendly software tool that enables researchers to explore and discover optimized quantum gate sets, with a focus on intuitive implementation, flexible workflows, and advanced analytical and reporting features.
