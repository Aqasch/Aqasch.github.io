Apart from my state-of-the-art interest in reading science relalted books [a link to the list of books will be here], I love to study novels which "connects human soul and soil" [link to a mentionable list of books here]. Once upon a time when I was having a long break in between the transition of school and college life, I tend to finish approximately twelve Bengali novels in month, without compromising with my hunger and sleep.  
Just recently I discovered my love to read and write poems [a link to poems will be posted]. During this discovery, the great Satyajit Ray's creations [a link to a list] and hobbies [a link to a list] worked as an inspiration to me.
