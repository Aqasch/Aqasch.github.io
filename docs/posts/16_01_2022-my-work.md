<span style="color:green"> **Fields:** </span>
- Quantum Physics
    - Optics,
    - Computing.
- Cosmology
    - Interacting dark energy models.

<span style="color:green"> **Tools for Better Understanding:** </span>
Before decomposing my works, the necessary (may not be sufficient) concepts (which I termed as tools in the subtitle) one should be aware are listed below:
-  <span style="color:brown"> **In quantum optics:** </span>
    - **Coherent states:** With the arrival and developement of lasers, and with the development of quantum theory of radiation, the states that very closely resembles *classical electromagnetic fields* were one of the primary focus of investigation. These closely-resembling-quantum-states are called *coherent states*.
        - **How to generate?** Using classical monochromatic current.
        - **Properties:** 
                - Eigenstate of Annihilation operator of the classical monochromatic field.
                - The wavepacket always has minimum uncertainty.
