Before decomposing my works, the necessary (may not be sufficient) concepts (which I termed as tools in the subtitle) one should be aware are listed below:
 
<span style="color:brown"> **<u> In quantum optics </u>** </span>

- **Coherent states:** With the arrival and developement of lasers, and with the development of quantum theory of radiation, the states that very closely resembles *classical electromagnetic fields* were one of the primary focus of investigation. These closely-resembling-quantum-states are called *coherent states*.

    - **How to generate?** Using classical monochromatic current.

    - **Properties:** 
            (1) Eigenstate of Annihilation operator of the classical monochromatic field.
            (2) The wavepacket always has minimum uncertainty.

    - **Uncertainty distribution:** In case of *classical electromagnetic fields* the waves has well-defined *phase* and *amplitude* i.e. one can measure them with full precision (if the measurement device is promised to be perfect). Meanwhile *quantum mechanically*, there are fluctuations (which arises uncertainty) associated with both the *phase* and *amplitude*. Notably, in *coherent states* the distribution of fluctuation in *phase* and *amplitude* is equal.

- **Squeezed State:** It is a special kind of state in which, the distribution of fluctuations one of the quadratures (i.e. either *amplitude* or *phase* as an example) are reduced below the symmetric quantum limit (i.e. below Heisengerg uncertainty limit). At first look it may look like these states violate Heisenberg uncertainty principle, but that is not the case as in the other canonically conjugate quadrature (mathematically speaking a canonically conjugate pair is defined in such a way that they are Fourier transform duals eg. *position* and *momentum*, *energy* and *time*) the distribution of fluctuation enhances in such manner that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is not violated.

    - **How to generate?** The most effective generation technique uses an *optical parametric oscillator* (*optical parametric amplification* + *optical cavity*) which generally speaking converts an incident laser wave into two output waves with lower frequency by using second order nonlinear optical interaction. More briefly, *optical parametric oscillator* can be constructed using a *nonlinear crystal* (i.e. crystals with nonlinear susceptibility and that are highly transparent to optical frequency eg. Lithium Niborate and Potassium titanyl phosphate) placed inbetween two or more mirrors (an *optical cavity*).

    - **Properties:** Uncertainty in one of quadrature goes below the standard quantum limit.

    - **Application:** Gravitational wave detection, Photon detection technique, optical comunication, noise-free amplication etc.
