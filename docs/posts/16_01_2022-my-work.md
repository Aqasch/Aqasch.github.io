Before decomposing my works, the necessary (may not be sufficient) concepts (which I termed as tools in the subtitle) one should be aware are listed below:
 
<span style="color:brown"> **<u> In quantum optics </u>** </span>
    - **Coherent states:** With the arrival and developement of lasers, and with the development of quantum theory of radiation, the states that very closely resembles *classical electromagnetic fields* were one of the primary focus of investigation. These closely-resembling-quantum-states are called *coherent states*.
        - **How to generate?** Using classical monochromatic current.
        - **Properties:** 
                (1) Eigenstate of Annihilation operator of the classical monochromatic field.
                (2) The wavepacket always has minimum uncertainty.
        - **Uncertainty distribution:** In case of *classical electromagnetic fields* the waves has well-defined *phase* and *amplitude* i.e. one can measure them with full precision (if the measurement device is promised to be perfect). Meanwhile *quantum mechanically*, there are fluctuations (which arises uncertainty) associated with both the *phase* and *amplitude*. Notably, in *coherent states* the distribution of fluctuation in *phase* and *amplitude* is equal.
