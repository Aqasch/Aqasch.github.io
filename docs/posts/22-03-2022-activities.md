## <span style="color:black"> **QIndia** </span>

QIndia is a part of global non-profit organization QWorld. Just like QWorld we bring quantum computing researchers & enthusiasts together non-profit organization with an additional focus on India. Our primary aim is to develop a robust, educative, collaborative, and informative community centred around Quantum technologies.

A class of independent and collaborated activities takes place in QIndia: 

- Notably our first (February, 2021) colaborative activity was [**QBronze50**](https://qworld.net/qbronze50-qindia/), where we successfully distributed 170 diplomas to the participants. In September 2021, QIndia conducted individual event [**QBronze67**](https://qworld.net/monsoon-school/), where we have successfully distribited 57 diplomas. In both of the events I had pleasure working along side other mentors.

- Under collaboration with QPoland, Quantum AI Foundation, QWorld, Christ University and CEBT we conducted an one day mini-conference on [**Quantum Machine Learning Workshop**](https://www.qaif.org/events/conferences/quantum-machine-learning-conference). I was one of the representers of QIndia.

#### **"Qoffee o'clock"** 

As a core member of QIndia I host bi-weekly meetings called **Qoffee o'clock**. The term "Qoffee" coined by combining the following facts (1) the host's addiction towards coffee (2) the quantum x (x = physics/computing/information/etc..). Combination of "Qoffee"+"o'clock" basically shouts **"it is time to grab a big mug of coffee and immerse into the world of quantum!"**. 
Till today I had a pleasure to host 8 amazing speakers/group of speakers from all around the world. All the talks are available online on ["QIndia's YouTube channel"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_diDPY4HK1sZWbS7So6Ejg). A summary of talks is given as follows:

- ["Variational Quantum Eigensolver : An Overview by yours truly."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdVf6O85kEM&t=1751s)
-["Macroscopic quantum experiments with superconducting magnetic levitation by Achintya Paradkar, Doctoral student at Chalmers Institute of Technology."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrA_wqrSlCY&t=2020s)
    - **short description:**  Magnetically levitated particles promise to reach ultra-low mechanical dissipation due to the absence of clamping and internal material losses, which are otherwise limiting factors in clamped nanomechanical resonators, and the absence of photon recoil heating, a limiting factor in optical levitation experiments. Furthermore, the magnetically levitated particle can be coupled via flux to superconducting circuits, which allows for quantum manipulation of its centre-of-mass (com) motion. Thus, magnetically levitated particles are a promising novel platform for developing ultra-sensitive force and acceleration sensors, both in the classical and in the quantum regime. In our project, we demonstrate the levitation of micrometre-sized superconducting particles by using a chip-based magnetic trap architecture. The chip-trap generates a quadrupole-like magnetic field of tunable strength. It is fabricated from multi-winding superconducting Niobium coils on two separate chips, which are stacked vertically. We have achieved levitation of sub-100 Âµm lead spheres at a temperature of 7 K in a low-vibration, dry cryostat when using a current larger than 0.3 A in the trap. Crucially, this current generates a strong magnetic lift force, which overcomes the van-der Waals force of the particle resting on the chip surface. Currently, we observe levitation by optical means. Experiments are underway to read out the com-motion using a SQUID, which will facilitate feedback cooling in order to reduce the phonon occupation of the com-motion. The latter is a requirement for future quantum control of particle motion. In parallel, we construct an experimental platform that enables levitation of the superconducting particle at mK temperature, which will facilitate coupling to superconducting circuits. Ultimately, this coupling allows the generation of quantum states of the com-motion, such as superposition or squeezed states, which are a crucial resource for quantum sensing experiments aiming at measuring minute forces, e.g., gravity.
