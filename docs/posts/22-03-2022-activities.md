## <span style="color:black"> **QIndia** </span>

QIndia is a part of global non-profit organization QWorld. Just like QWorld we bring quantum computing researchers & enthusiasts together non-profit organization with an additional focus on India. Our primary aim is to develop a robust, educative, collaborative, and informative community centred around Quantum technologies.

A class of independent and collaborated activities takes place in QIndia: 

- Notably our first (February, 2021) colaborative activity was [**QBronze50**](https://qworld.net/qbronze50-qindia/), where we successfully distributed 170 diplomas to the participants. In September 2021, QIndia conducted individual event [**QBronze67**](https://qworld.net/monsoon-school/), where we have successfully distribited 57 diplomas. In both of the events I had pleasure working along side other mentors.

- Under collaboration with QPoland, Quantum AI Foundation, QWorld, Christ University and CEBT we conducted an one day mini-conference on [**Quantum Machine Learning Workshop**](https://www.qaif.org/events/conferences/quantum-machine-learning-conference). I was one of the representers of QIndia.

### **Qoffee o'clock** 

As a core member of QIndia I host bi-weekly meetings called **Qoffee o'clock**. The term "Qoffee" coined by combining the following facts (1) the host's addiction towards coffee (2) the quantum x (x = physics/computing/information/etc..). Combination of "Qoffee"+"o'clock" basically shouts **"it is time to grab a big mug of coffee and immerse into the world of quantum!"**. 
Till today I had a pleasure to host 8 amazing speakers/group of speakers from all around the world. All the talks are available online on ["QIndia's YouTube channel"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_diDPY4HK1sZWbS7So6Ejg). A summary of talks is given as follows:
