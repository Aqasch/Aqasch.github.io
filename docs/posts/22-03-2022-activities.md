## <span style="color:black"> **QIndia** </span>

QIndia is a part of global non-profit organization QWorld. Just like QWorld we bring quantum computing researchers & enthusiasts together non-profit organization with an additional focus on India. Our primary aim is to develop a robust, educative, collaborative, and informative community centred around Quantum technologies.

A class of independent and collaborated activities takes place in QIndia: 

- Notably our first (February, 2021) colaborative activity was [**QBronze50**](https://qworld.net/qbronze50-qindia/), where we successfully distributed 170 diplomas to the participants. In September 2021, QIndia conducted individual event [**QBronze67**](https://qworld.net/monsoon-school/), where we have successfully distribited 57 diplomas. In both of the events I had pleasure working along side other mentors.

- Under collaboration with QPoland, Quantum AI Foundation, QWorld, Christ University and CEBT we conducted an one day mini-conference on [**Quantum Machine Learning Workshop**](https://www.qaif.org/events/conferences/quantum-machine-learning-conference). I was one of the representers of QIndia.

### **Qoffee o'clock** 

As a core member of QIndia I host bi-weekly meetings called **Qoffee o'clock**. The term "Qoffee" coined by combining the following facts (1) the host's addiction towards coffee (2) the quantum x (x = physics/computing/information/etc..). Combination of "Qoffee"+"o'clock" basically shouts **"it is time to grab a big mug of coffee and immerse into the world of quantum!"**. 
Till today I had a pleasure to host 8 amazing speakers/group of speakers from all around the world. All the talks are available online on ["QIndia's YouTube channel"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_diDPY4HK1sZWbS7So6Ejg). A summary of talks is given as follows:

- [**"Macroscopic quantum experiments with superconducting magnetic levitation by Achintya Paradkar, Doctoral student at Chalmers Institute of Technology."**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrA_wqrSlCY&t=2020s)
    - **short description:**  Magnetically levitated particles promise to reach ultra-low mechanical dissipation due to the absence of clamping and internal material losses, which are otherwise limiting factors in clamped nanomechanical resonators, and the absence of photon recoil heating, a limiting factor in optical levitation experiments. Furthermore, the magnetically levitated particle can be coupled via flux to superconducting circuits, which allows for quantum manipulation of its centre-of-mass (com) motion. Thus, magnetically levitated particles are a promising novel platform for developing ultra-sensitive force and acceleration sensors, both in the classical and in the quantum regime. In our project, we demonstrate the levitation of micrometre-sized superconducting particles by using a chip-based magnetic trap architecture. The chip-trap generates a quadrupole-like magnetic field of tunable strength. It is fabricated from multi-winding superconducting Niobium coils on two separate chips, which are stacked vertically. We have achieved levitation of sub-100 µm lead spheres at a temperature of 7 K in a low-vibration, dry cryostat when using a current larger than 0.3 A in the trap. Crucially, this current generates a strong magnetic lift force, which overcomes the van-der Waals force of the particle resting on the chip surface. Currently, we observe levitation by optical means. Experiments are underway to read out the com-motion using a SQUID, which will facilitate feedback cooling in order to reduce the phonon occupation of the com-motion. The latter is a requirement for future quantum control of particle motion. In parallel, we construct an experimental platform that enables levitation of the superconducting particle at mK temperature, which will facilitate coupling to superconducting circuits. Ultimately, this coupling allows the generation of quantum states of the com-motion, such as superposition or squeezed states, which are a crucial resource for quantum sensing experiments aiming at measuring minute forces, e.g., gravity.

- [**"An interdisciplinary introduction to Quantum Computation by Aritra Sarkar, Doctoral scholar, QuTech, Delft University of Technology."**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSEJjrU_pvU)
    - **short description:** Starting from basic questions like "what are computers?" we will explore what to expect from current and future quantum computers, their advantages and limitations. Join me on a journey through the landscapes of mathematics, physics, computer science, economics and philosophy - to revisit some of the most obvious questions that are often overlooked.

- [**"Prospects and Challenges of the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm by Ritajit Majumdar; Doctoral student, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata."**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW9zE_pZT2A)
    - **short desctiption:** Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), studied widely in the literature primarily to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, is a potential candidate for quantum advantage in near-term devices. However, recent experiments from Google show that the performance of the QAOA on their current hardware fails to meet the theoretical promise. Henceforth, some modifications to the components of the algorithm have been suggested in the literature for its faster convergence. In this talk, we shall give a short introduction to the QAOA, briefly delve into some of its modifications suggested in the literature, and discuss some of the challenges associated with the QAOA.

- [**"Detection of glassy dynamics using Quantum computer by Turbasu Chatterjee: Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (India), Ishmam Shah: University of Dhaka (Bangladesh), and Arnav Das: Kazi Nazrul University (India)."**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxBQqkj8L3g)
    - **short description:** Glassy systems are considered to be one of the most interesting problems in physics. Disordered phase and meta-stable ground states are the hallmarks of a glassy system. Hence in this talk, we briefly discuss a method for observing glassy characteristics using VQE for Traverse field Ising model and Cellular Potts model by discussing its possible applications.

- [**"Quantum Internet; Why and How? by Salini Karuvade, PhD Candidate, Institute for Quantum Science and Technology, University of Calgary"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jpP1u9pNdY)
    - **short description:** A functional quantum internet will revolutionalize the field of communications technology through its applications ranging from secure information transfer to quantum-enhanced sensing. In the first part of my talk, I discuss why it is necessary to build the quantum internet by focusing on its potential impacts on areas such as cryptography, distributed computing and clock synchronization. In the second part of the talk, I discuss how to build the quantum internet by drawing parallels with the classical internet. I elaborate on the role of teleportation in constructing the quantum internet and on the layered network architecture that forms the basis of several recent developments in the field.

- [**"Quantum State Tomography and Continuous Variable Quantum States by Ludmila S. Botelho, PhD student at the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Informatics, Polish Academy of Sciences. "**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeDSd6SJsGw)
    - **short description:** Given an unknown quantum state, what are the necessary ingredients to characterize it? And why do we even care?
    The task of estimating density matrices based on measurement results, or simply Quantum State Tomography (QST), is essential for characterizing optical signals as well as in quantum computing and quantum information theory to reliably determine the actual states of the qubits. Alternatively, in the case of continuous variable quantum states, one could be interested in reconstructing the states Wigner function instead density matrix. However it is well known that the number of measurements to fully characterize a state grows polynomially with dimension of the state.
    So, in this talk we give an introduction to QST, which is follows up with a discuss about a simple method to reconstruct the Wigner function of many-mode continuous variable systems.

- [**"Introduction to Universal Blind Quantum Computation, by Rijul Sachdeva, Doctoral Scholar at Forschungszentrun Jülich, Germany"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Zk9ubfKmI)
    - **short description:** Universal Blind Quantum Computation (UBQC) is an example of a protocol in which quantum physics gives rise to unique security properties in the computation setting. It is a computation scheme, in which a client wishes to make use of a quantum computer provided by a server, but in a way that the server is "blind" to the computation that the client is running, i.e., the server is unable to come into possession of any intelligible data for this computation. In the talk, an introduction to UBQC will be given.
