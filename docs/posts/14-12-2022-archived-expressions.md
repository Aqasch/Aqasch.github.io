<h2 id="shima_on_mini"><b>Doctor Toratarō Shima on finding the DC Mini</b></h2>

DC Mini, that allows the user to experience someone's dream is the core object, surrounding which the whole plot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika_(novel)"><b>Paprika by Yasutaka Tsutsui</b></a> is formulated and later re-illustrated beautifull in the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika_(2006_film)"><b>Paprika (2006) by none other than great Satoshi Kon</b></a>. The device itself can have huge negative implications if pursued by an ill-minded human being. Now one DC Mini is missing! And to find the DC Mini they approached the head of the initiative Doctor Seijirō Inui. Approximately 15 minutes in the movie the characters realized that DC Mini has an implication to the non-dream world as well and it can potentially be used as a mediator for overlapping the dream and non-dream world. The whole conclusion on the previous sentence triggered by an incident that happened throgh Doctor Toratarō Shima who is one of the core characters; around 10 minutes in the movie. 
<span style="color:green"><b>Seems posessed by an unknown force the doctor quotes (in the dubbed version of the movie, and in my opinion it is greatly dubbed!): </b></span>
<p>
</p>

<p><b>"We need to find the mini</b> (the lost one)<b>, not Paprika's bikini</b> (which is non sensical as paprika basically a lady that appears in dreams)<b>, it requires descipline!</b>"<br>

<p> One of the characters shockingly says <b>"Discipline?"</b><br>

<p><b>"Yes sir! True satisfaction! That what discipline brings! Even the fine court ladies dancing to frog food in drums has it, so did the world with recycled papers!"</b><br>

<p><b>"Computer graphics playing in my head, and I love it!!"</b><br>
<p>...<br>
...

<p><b>"Now the time has come, to return to home, the great blue sky, where confetti falls like stardust and everything shaken around the shrine-gates and the mailbox and refrigator, leading hiphop festival!"</b><br>

<p><b>"and the whole festival was put together by twenty third graders, lots of chutzpah and one panda!"</b><br>

<p>Then the sublime <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF2oOrsea3U"><b>Parade</b></a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susumu_Hirasawa"><b>Susumu Hirasawa</b></a>,  begins with slow pace and gradually increases by each and every second. Simultaneously Doctor Shima runs with full force on the corridor and screams<br>

<p><b>"You see now!? I am truly grand! The ultimate! Shine! Shine! Take me! Take me now!"</b><br>

<p>Ultimately he jumps from the window, by breaking the window glass. Fortunately, his pace was quite uniform throughout the running and jumping process so his pace towards the ground from (probably) the 3rd floor of the building hindered by the tree branches and he just broke a few bones.<br>

<h2 id="brief_on_mini"><b>A Brief on DC Mini</b></h2>

To investigate the above incident Detective Toshimi Konakawa indulge in a conversation with the inventor of the DC Mini Doctor Kōsaku Tokita. 
<span style="color:green"><b>Curious detective asks the motivation and function of DC Mini, which is compiled in the following conversation:</b></span>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>"It all started when I was doing a brain scan on a patient using a state-of-the-art computer image processor, and the idea came to me like a lightning bolt."</b> Dr. Tokita excitedly remarks.<br>

<p>Then the doctor continues <b>"The nonlinear waves, that are created by the constant surges in the biochemical current can be applied to create new synapse connections, when the old ones are damaged, and the by product of this excess energy can be harvested by adjusting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_thermal_unit">BTU output</a>."</b><br>

<p>The detective then says <b>"... interesting! So DC Mini can analyse dreams,</b> (that has potential application in the process of) <b>cure illness and use the person's body</b> (indicating the adjustment of BTU output) <b>for energy!</b>"

আগন্তুক is undoubtedly a masterpiece in the world of art and films and produced by none other than the great সত্যজিৎ রায়.

<b>“সভ্য কারা জানেন? সভ্য হচ্ছে সেই মানুষ, যে আঙ্গুলের একটি চাপে, একটি বোতামটিপে, একটি ব্রহ্মাস্ত্র নিক্ষেপ করে, সমস্থ অধিবাসীসমেত একটি গোঁটা শহরকে নিশ্চিহ্ন করে দিতে পারে!"<br>

<b>"এবং সভ্য কারা জানেন? যারা এই অস্ত্র প্রয়োগের সিদ্ধিন্ত নিতে পারে without turning a hair”</b>
