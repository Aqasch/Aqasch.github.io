## <span style="color:black"><b>Doctor Toratarō Shima on finding the DC Mini</b></span>

DC Mini, that allows the user to experience someone's dream is the core object, surrounding which the whole plot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika_(novel)"><b>Paprika by Yasutaka Tsutsui</b></a> is formulated and later re-illustrated beautifull in the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika_(2006_film)"><b>Paprika by none other than great Satoshi Kon</b></a>. The device itself can have huge negative implications if pursued by an ill-minded human being. Now one DC Mini is missing! And to find the DC Mini they approached the head of the initiative Doctor Seijirō Inui. Approximately 15 minutes in the movie the characters realized that DC Mini has an implication to the non-dream world as well and it can potentially be used as a mediator for overlapping the dream and non-dream world. The whole conclusion on the previous sentence triggered by an incident that happened throgh Doctor Toratarō Shima who is one of the core characters; around 10 minutes in the movie.

<p><b>"We need to find the mini</b> (the lost one)<b>, not Paprika's bikini</b> (which is non sensical as paprika basically a lady that appears in dreams)<b>, it requires descipline!</b>"<br>

<p> One of the characters shockingly says <b>"Discipline?"</b><br>

<p><b>"Yes sir! True satisfaction! That what discipline brings! Even the fine court ladies dancing to frog food in drums has it, so did the world with recycled papers!"</b><br>

<p><b>"Computer graphics playing in my head, and I love it!!"</b><br>

<p><b>"Now the time has come, to return to home, the great blue sky, where confetti falls like stardust and eberythinhg shaken around the shrine-gates and the mailbox and refrigator, leading hiphop festival!"</b><br>

<p><b>"and the whole festival was put together by twenty third graders, lots of chutzpah and one panda!"</b><br>

<p>Then the sublime <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF2oOrsea3U"><b>Parade</b></a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susumu_Hirasawa"><b>Susumu Hirasawa</b></a>,  begins with slow pace and gradually increases by each and every second. Simultaneously Doctor Shima runs with full force on the corridor and screams<br>

<p><b>"You see now!? I am truly grand! The ultimate! Shine! Shine! Take me! Take me now!"</b><br>

<p>Ultimately he jumps from the window, by breaking the window glass. Fortunately, his pace was quite uniform throughout the running and jumping process so his pace towards the ground from (probably) the 3rd floor of the building hindered by the tree branches and he just broke a few bones.<br>
